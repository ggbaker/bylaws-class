# Bylaws

This repository provides a class for typesetting governing documents (such as bylaws or corporate charters). The styling is *very* roughly inspired by the formatting of the bylaws of the [National Association of Parliamentarians](https://www.parliamentarians.org).

## Prequisites

1. XeLaTeX - This should be included in the full version of any standard TeX installation. Some standard editors may automatically use the correct compiler, but you may have to change it manually in settings. (XeLaTeX enables the use of system fonts.)
2. [Libertinus Typefaces](https://github.com/alif-type/libertinus) - This is a fork of the popular Linux Libertine family.

* Of course, please feel free to modify the code to meet your own needs. Typefaces are specified using the fontspec package, so it should be easy enough to change it to one better suiting your needs. If you're happy to use stanard LaTeX fonts, you might be able to remove the lines relating to typeface specification and then use the standard LaTeX compiler.
